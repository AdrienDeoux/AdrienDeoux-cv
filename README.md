# lemaki-cv

The content in this CV is subject to change quite often and might even get out of date at some point.
To convert this HTML to a PDF file, you should use a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Opera...)
and print it with 50% zoom.

## TODO

* A printer-friendly version
* Figure out a way to separate development on the template and development on my CV
