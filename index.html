          For 5 months in 2017, as an intern in <em>Starburst Computing</em>, I
          designed a graphical user interface aimed at helping users set up a
          gaming environment comprised of multiple devices communicating in real
          time. I implemented a working prototype for desktop platforms using
          <strong>Electron</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,
          <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>RxJS</strong>.

          In early 2018, I followed a one week long training course on
          <strong>Angular 5</strong> and <strong>Typescript</strong> delivered
          by <em>Viveris Technologies</em>. Since March 2019, I have had the
          opportunity to develop those skills by designing an interactive
          wireframe in <strong>Angular 7</strong> for a new project as part of
          my mission in the <em>French Ministry of Education</em>. This project
          is being actively developed by myself and 3 other developers and will
          use <strong>Angular</strong> as the front-end framework, and a
          <strong>Java J2EE</strong> API in the back-end.

          In 2016, I got introduced to <strong>Node.js</strong> during a
          research project in <em>TELECOM Nancy</em>, the school where I studied
          computer science. The goal was to design a standard API to manage
          various IoT devices (lamps, speakers...) over various protocols (UPnP,
          Bluetooth...). Another student and I implemented a prototype in
          <strong>Node</strong> with support for <em>Phillips Hue</em> devices.
          Aside from <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, other
          projects in the <strong>Node/NPM/Javacript</strong> ecosystem include:
          <ul>
            <li>Building a small musical blind test application for another
              school project</li>
            <li>Using <strong>Vue</strong> as a view library to add

          Since the beginning of my mission for the <em>Ministry of
            Education</em> in December 2017, I have met a lot of different
          people, most of them more experienced and more back-end-minded than I
          am. This has been an opportunity to learn a lot about common patterns
          (dependency injection, for instance), how the French education system
          works, what the different teams' development methodologies are, and
          how the technologies that we have been using work
          (<strong>Spring</strong>, <strong>Hibernate</strong>,
          <strong>Jenkins</strong>, just to name a few).

          I have also been able to share my own knowledge of modern front end
          technologies to my teammates and to assist them with everything
          design-related. This led me to design an interactive wireframe for a
          new project, which will be the team's first large-scale publicly
          available application. Concerns of user experience and accessibility
          have thus been declared a priority, and I was tasked to look up and
          document best practices on the matter.

          During my mission in the ministry, I decided to develop a
          <strong>Python</strong> application to automate the installation of
          all the necessary tools for new developers from any team who choose to
          work on a Linux machine. I also assisted other teams more directly
          with development when our own team could afford it. <br>
          In 2016, while I was studying in <em>TELECOM Nancy</em>, I was elected
          head of the clubs for one year. My primary responsibility was to
          advise all 24 clubs in the school for their daily activity and discuss
          financial and legal matters with the head of the association.

          In 2015, during my first year in <em>TELECOM Nancy</em>, I was elected

          managed a cumulated 40000€ worth of stock and coordinated the
          preparation of up to 100 meals a day, for one year. From a technical
          standpoint, I also helped maintain the order and stock management
          server.
