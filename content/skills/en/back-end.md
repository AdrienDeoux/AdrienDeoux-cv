From **March** to **August 2021**, was an trainee engineer at **Ifremer**. I've had the 
opportunity to study the bubbling phenomenon using **multibeam sounder** and 
**Doppler current meter** recordings from the ship "Pourquoi pas?". I was able 
to process netCDF data, work in an oceanographic and hydrographic environment, and
apply **decision trees** and **random forests** to establish correlation between the 
different observed metrics.

From **June** to **August 2020**, was an intern for my school laboratory. In the early
days of the COVID-19 crisis, I was creating a **machine learning** model to diagnose coronavirus
in a patient lungs bases on CT scans. I tested various concept but mostly trained 
**convolutional neural networks** thanks to Tensorflow, Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries from Python.

During a school project in **2019/2020**, developed a prototype for a medical application
contouring wounds using a 3D camera. I was **scrum master** in a team of 4 people coding in various 
languages for reasons of communication and understanding, both with the customer and with the other 
team members who come from different programs.
