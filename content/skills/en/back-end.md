# Backend development

![java][java]
From **December 2017** to **September 2019**, maintained a **JavaEE**
application for the **Ministry of Education**. This application is used by every
region in France to assign middle schoolers to high schools (or equivalent)
using a variety of customisable criteria such as grades or location.
Technologies used include **Spring**, **Hibernate**, **Quartz**, **IBM DB2** and
**Apache Struts 1**.

![python][python]
During a school project in **early 2017**, developed a small HTTP service using
**Python**, whose goal was to compute the number of non-working days between two
given dates.

![node][node]
During a school project in **early 2016**, developed a prototype for a
**Node.js** API whose aim was to provide developers with a standard way of
detecting and controling IoT devices regardless of vendor or network technology
used (Bluetooth, LAN...).
